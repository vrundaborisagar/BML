# Logistic Regression

## Introduction
Logistic Regression is a fundamental classification algorithm used in machine learning to predict categorical outcomes based on input features. It is widely used for binary classification problems, such as spam detection, medical diagnosis, and fraud detection.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib (optional, for visualization)

## Installation
Ensure you have the required libraries installed using the following command:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## Steps to Implement Logistic Regression

### 1. Importing Libraries
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report, confusion_matrix
```

### 2. Loading the Dataset
```python
df = pd.read_csv('dataset.csv')
print(df.head())
```

### 3. Data Preprocessing
- **Handle missing values:**
  ```python
  df.dropna(inplace=True)
  ```
- **Feature Scaling:**
  ```python
  scaler = StandardScaler()
  df[['Feature1', 'Feature2']] = scaler.fit_transform(df[['Feature1', 'Feature2']])
  ```

### 4. Splitting the Data
```python
X = df.drop('Target', axis=1)
y = df['Target']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

### 5. Training the Logistic Regression Model
```python
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### 6. Making Predictions
```python
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
```

### 7. Evaluating the Model
```python
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
print("Classification Report:\n", classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
print("Confusion Matrix:\n", confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))
```

## Conclusion
Logistic Regression is an effective and easy-to-implement algorithm for binary classification problems. Proper data preprocessing and feature scaling help in improving model performance.

## Usage
1. Place your dataset in the project directory.
2. Modify feature columns as per your dataset.
3. Run the script to train and evaluate the Logistic Regression model.
